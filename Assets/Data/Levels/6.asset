  tutorialText: You can also crossbreed humans to make more predictable variations
    of genes. The genes of a child are random values inside the gene ranges of their
    parents. To start crossbreeding pick up a human and drag it on another one. Make
    sure their genes are different enough to not cause inbreeding.
